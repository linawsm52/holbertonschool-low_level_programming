# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

##  Description
This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming track.  
It focuses on implementing and understanding **hash tables** â€” a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides very fast lookups.

In this task, we are asked to:
- Write a function that creates a hash table.
- Return a pointer to the newly created hash table.
- Return `NULL` if something went wrong.
